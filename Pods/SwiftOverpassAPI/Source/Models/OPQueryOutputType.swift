	Output types that effect the structure of JSON data returned by an Overpass API request.

	Standard: Returned elements contain refrence ids to their child elements.

	Recurse down: Standard output but query will return child objects for any parent element returned in the initial query. For example, querying a relation will also return any ways and/or nodes that are members in that relation.

	Recurse up: Standard output but query will return parent objects for any child element returned in the initial query. Fore example, querying for a node will also return any ways and/or relations that the node is a member of.

	Recurse up and down: Recurse up, then recurse down on the result of the upwards recursion.

	Geometry: Each returned element will contain a list of coorindates that define it's geometry.

	Center: Each returned element will contain it's center point. Use this if you are only concerned with representing the element as a single point or marker on a map.
